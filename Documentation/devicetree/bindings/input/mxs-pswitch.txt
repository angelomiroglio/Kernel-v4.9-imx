* Digi International MXS power switch device tree bindings

The Freescale's MX28 SoC has a pswitch pin which has several power related
functions determined by a product's hardware and software design.

The pswitch keyboard driver allow for the user space handling of power events
like suspend to RAM or poweroff.

Required properties:

- compatible: Should be "digi,mxs-pswitch".

- reg: Physical base address of the power hardware subsystem and length of the
        memory mapped region.

- interrupts: The pswitch interrupt number.

- linux,code: The linux key code the event maps to.

Example:

        pswitch@80044000 {
                compatible = "digi,mxs-pswitch";
                linux,code = <116>;
                interrupts = <6>;
        };
