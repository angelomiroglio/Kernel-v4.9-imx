WIRELESS

Required properties:

  - compatible: "atheros,ath6kl"

Optional properties:

  - digi,pwrdown-gpios: GPIOs used to power down the wireless chip.
  - digi,pwrdown_delay: Delay in ms between power down GPIO toggling.
  - ath6kl-p2p-enable: boolean to enable driver's 'p2p' support (wifi direct).
  - ath6kl-softmac-enable: boolean to enable setting interface's MAC address
                           from 'softmac' firmware file.
  - ath6kl-reg-domain: Force the specified regulatory domain on firmware load.
		       The regulatory domain is encoded as a 16 bits number.
		       For a list of regulatory domain codes refer to the
		       Atheros MKG-0920 document, "Setup for Country or
		       regulatory domain on AR6002-Based target firmware".
  - ath6kl-debug-mask: Debug mask (32 bits) to enable debug output on the
		       atheros host driver. For valid masks refer to the
		       file drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath6kl/debug.h.

Example:

	wireless {
		compatible = "atheros,ath6kl"
		ath6kl-p2p-enable;
		ath6kl-softmac-enable;
		ath6kl-reg-domain = /bits/ 16 <0xd7>;
		ath6kl-debug-mask = <0x00000040>;
		digi,pwrdown-gpios = <&gpio_extender 3 0>;
		digi,pwrdown_delay = <5>;
		/* U-Boot will fill in the MAC address here */
	};
